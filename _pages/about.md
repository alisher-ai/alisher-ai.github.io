I’m Alisher Abdulkhaev, a machine learning engineer mostly working on computer vision tasks. 

I have graduated with electrical and electronics engineering in my bachelor's and master's degrees. Since then I have been working in the industry as a machine learning engineer. 

My industrial journey started at [Rakuten, RIT](https://rit.rakuten.co.jp), as an intern, where I worked on an image retrieval project. Then started at [PKSHA Technology](https://pkshatech.com/ja/) as both a researcher and machine learning engineer where I implemented the face detection algorithm. The implemented algorithm was selected by Toyota Motor Corporation and deployed on production.

Then, I joined another startup company in Singapore - [Browzzin](https://browzzin.com). At Browzzin, I implement various computer vision algorithms to make our [image recognition engine](https://browzzin.ai) more powerful and robust.

Currently, working at ROMS (Robotics Omni Channel Solutions) in Tokyo. I am leading a team of 10 people (including part-timers) of robotics, AI, and software engineers. We develop a robotic piece-picking system capable of picking any item in the e-commerce and logistic market. 

Apart from my professional life, I am also dealing with community-driven NPO — [Machine Learning Tokyo](https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/). I am a board member and community lead at MLT. We are organizing and hosting hundreds of talks, study sessions, and discussions. MLT is a community of around 8,000 machine learning engineers and researchers from all over the world. There are multiple very cool projects initiated by MLT. For further details, you could visit [MLT website](https://mltokyo.ai) and [MLT Blog](https://machinelearningtokyo.com). Check out our [papers-with-annotation](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/papers-with-annotations) project in which we annotate the published machine learning papers and share them with the community!

In 2020, I started my Ph.D. journey at [CVLAB, University of Tsukuba](https://en.home.cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/home) under the supervision of [Prof. Fukui](http://www.cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~kfukui/english/indexE.html). However, due to very massive busy work, I had to take a leave of absence in 2022.

Passionate about making machine learning accessible and advancing in the field of multi-modal foundation models.

Thank you very much for taking the time to read about me and please feel free to reach out with anything you have in mind!
